Self-directed practice reading in .xlsx making it tidy

In 2015, I created an If This Then That (ifttt.com) recipe that appended a new line to a Google Spreadsheet every time there was a new job posting that matched keywords such as "data scientist," "software engineer," or "developer."

The spreadsheet it created has 2000 entries with only 3 columns. 

The R script in this repo is meant to clean and tidy the data so it's ready for exploratory analysis.
