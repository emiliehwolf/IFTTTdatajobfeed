# IFTTTdatajobfeed
This is self-directed practice for reading in an Excel spreadsheet and making it tidy.

In 2015, I created an If This Then That (ifttt.com) recipe that appended a new line to a Google Spreadsheet every time there was a new job posting that matched keywords such as "data scientist," "software engineer," or "developer" in the Austin, TX area.

The IFTTT recipe created a messy spreadsheet of 2000 entries and 3 columns that contain multiple variables 

The R script jobfeedclean.R is meant to split the columns and tidy the data so it's ready for exploratory analysis.
